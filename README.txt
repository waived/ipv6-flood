 /// IPv6 DoS Attack ///
///////////////////////

Scope:
   The idea is to attack IPv6 addresses (most often cellphones are
   assigned an IPv6 address, but not always) by abusing both the
   UDP and TCP protocol.

Example:
   in the example 'screenshot.png' file, the default IPv6 loopback
   address of '::1' was used to confirm functionality. IPv6 addresses
   can be annoying. Ensure you have the correct IPv6 address before
   sending an attack!
